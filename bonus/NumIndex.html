        <p> Based on a previous experience, this site was created with the purpose to create an basic guessing game.</br>
        <br>The computer has generated a number between 0 - 50. You only have around 9 chances to get the right number. there will be hints if you get the wrong number, whichever you receive depends on how close or far you were with your initial guess:</br>
        <ul>
            <li> (warm) : Higher/Lower, between a margin of 0-5</li>
            <li> (chilly) : Higher/Lower, between a margin of 6-15</li>
            <li> (cold) : Higher/Lower, between a margin of 16-25</li>
            <li> (artic) : Higher/Lower, of a margin between 26-50</li>
        </ul>
        <br>good luck</br>
